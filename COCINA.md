# COCINA

COCINA is the conceptual architecture emerging from TACO Truck. The architecture is heavily influenced by Stanford Libraries' needs to move our digital repository forward in a piecemeal and scalable fashion. COCINA has the primary goals of being:

* API- & Data-centric enabling flexibility & extensibility of components
* Profile- & Specification-driven technology
* Make the data model complex, not the code components
* Smaller, less complex & less coupled components
* Easier for users from devs to sysadmins to admins to grok
