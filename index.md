TACO Truck is a only slightly frivolous holder term for Stanford Libraries' new digital repository architecture & implementation based on COCINA.

We are separating our implementation and architectural refinement (TACO Truck) from the conceptual architecture (COCINA) in order to enable future overlap with community partners and existing projects that need a modular and scalable digital repository approach.

### [COCINA](COCINA.md)

COCINA is the conceptual architecture emerging from TACO Truck. The architecture is heavily influenced by Stanford Libraries' needs to move our digital repository forward in a piecemeal and scalable fashion.

COCINA has the primary goals of being:

* API- & Data-centric enabling flexibility & extensibility of components
* Profile- & Specification-driven technology
* Make the data model complex, not the code components
* Smaller, less complex & less coupled components
* Easier for users from devs to sysadmins to admins to grok

Read more about [COCINA here](COCINA.md).


### [TACO Truck (formerly "SDR3")](TACO-Truck.md)

Stanford Libraries' prototype and implementation of COCINA is called TACO Truck.

Our goals for TACO Truck are:

* Improved performance throughout the system
* Higher availability of components & resources
* Ease of Setup, Maintenance, Adjustments, & Monitoring
* Cloud-first but Cloud-neutral
* And all the goals listed above for COCINA.

## Community Feedback on COCINA & TACO Truck

We are in the process of having a series of interviews with community partners to get feedback. This is meant to help us check presumptions and direction outside of our Stanford echo chamber. As feedback is gathered, we will keep an aggregated and anonymized form here.
