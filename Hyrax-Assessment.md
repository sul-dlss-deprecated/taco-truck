# Hyrax Assessment for TACO Truck Deposit & Administration

WIP.

* Hydrox is a project of DLSS to implement Hyrax, the Samvera repository front end, for use at Stanford.
Related to the Hybox / Hydra-in-a-Box Project.
    * Hydrox is a parallel but close partner effort to SDR3.
* Hydrox Integration into SDR2 and SDR3 is an active discussion topic.
* Under discussion & integration analysis:
    * Hydrox possibly serving as a community-aligned Self-Deposit application.
    * Hydrox eventually, maybe serving our needs for future Deposit more broadly or for our future Administrative Interface.
    * Hydrox, Hydrus, ETDs, Argo, Pre-Assembly Gap Analysis.
